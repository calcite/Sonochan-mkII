As root copy file 99-sonochan_mkII.rules to
 /etc/udev/rules.d/99-sonochan_mkII.rules

Restart udev (or reboot). After that all uses in group "usb" should have r/w
 access to ALL (!) HID devices. If you are paranoid, just change tthis rule
 according to your security.
Also all users should have access to Sonochan mkII as sound card.

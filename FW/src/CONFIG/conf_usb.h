 * To enumerate as a USB composite device:
 * HID (generic HID interface, compatible with Jan Axelson's generichid.exe test programs
 * DG8SAQ (libusb API compatible interface for implementing DG8SAQ EP0 type of interface)
 * Audio (Audio Class v1 and Audio Class V2.  Tweaked for
 * 		compatibility when running at HIGH speed USB.)
